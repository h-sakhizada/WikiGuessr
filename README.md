### TODO

- create a table in db to track generated articles so we can link victories, completion status, leaderboard rankings, etc. to specific days/articles.
- create an algo to allow for more flexibility in guesses to allow for easier correct guesses without exact spelling accuracy (fuzzy match of title counts as correct)
- add more details to profile (exclude from scoreboard, choose badges to display on profile, featured badge to overlay in top corner of profile picture)
- improve random article algoritm to ensure all hints actually contain data
- create a useDailyGame hook to ensure daily game is the same for each user
- implement payment system to allow for proper upgrading to premium
- create badge system
- create xp/currency system to buy badges?
